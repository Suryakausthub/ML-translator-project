Abstract—Due to the language differences involved, there are lots of issues while translating Telugu which is a low resource language to Hindi, which is one of the most widely used languages  in India. This research presents the different models of advanced machine translation such as OpenNMT, Fairseq machine   translation, Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-MT, and BART or Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive transformers to solve these challenges. It is for this reason that the study expects to engage in systematic experimentation of these models under various parameter conditions with the overall aim of ascertaining their parametric ability to produce contextually correct translations. The primary aim here is to determine which models and approaches lead to improvement of the quality of translations, thus helping improve on the existing solutions for underrepresented languages such as Telugu. Dubbed as The Roadmap for enhancing accessibility and communicational opportunities in low-resource languages with MT, the findings of this research will positively impact the particular field.
